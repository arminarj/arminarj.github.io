About Me
======
Hi, I’m **Mehdi Arjmand**, but I go by **Armin**. I’m a third-year Ph.D. student at [Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), where I work in the [Relational Agents Group](https://relationalagents.com/) under the supervision of [Timothy Bickmore](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/timothy-bickmore/). My academic journey began at the [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/), where I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and conducted research on multimodal machine learning for emotion recognition, guided by [Hadi Moradi](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~moradih) and [Mohammad Javad Dousti](http://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/mjdousti). Additionally, I had the opportunity to intern with the [Affective Computing Lab](https://www.mjdousti.com) at USC’s [Institute for Creative Technologies](https://ict.usc.edu/), working with Prof[Gale Lucas](https://ict.usc.edu/profile/gale-lucas/).

**Research Interests**

My research focuses on **conversational agents**, **multimodal interaction**, and **affective computing**. Currently, I’m developing AI agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) and multimodal interaction techniques to provide empathy and achieve conversational grounding, particularly in health-related contexts such as symptom reporting and motivational interviewing. My work is dedicated to advancing human-computer interaction (HCI) by creating agents that are emotionally intelligent and capable of meaningful communication, while fostering trust to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of these interactions.
