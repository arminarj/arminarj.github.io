About Me
======
Hi, I’m **Mehdi Arjmand**, but I go by **Armin**. I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), where I work in the [Relational Agents Group](https://relationalagents.com/) under the supervision of [Timothy Bickmore](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/timothy-bickmore/). Previously, I interned at [USC Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT)](https://ict.usc.edu/) and [Disney Research Imagineering](https://la.disneyresearch.com/), working on persuasive and multimodal interaction for multi-agent systems. My academic journey began at the [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/), where I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and conducted research on multimodal machine learning for emotion recognition.

**Research Interests**

My research explores **conversational agents**, **multimodal interaction**, and **affective computing**, with a focus on healthcare applications. I develop AI agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) and multimodal interaction techniques to engage in meaningful and empathetic communication in health-related contexts, such as symptom reporting and motivational interviewing. By incorporating psychological theories, my work aims to design advanced conversational agents that not only assist in healthcare tasks but also deepen our understanding of human multimodal behavior through their interactions.
